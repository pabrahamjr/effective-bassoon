## Components

Udacity provided starter code files (HTML and CSS styling) to display a static version of the Memory Game project. I have converted these files to become an interactive game by modifying the HTML, CSS and JavaScript files.  As part of the starter code, Udacity provided a link to Font-Awesome which provides the card icons, as well as a google API for accessing the Coda font.  Udacity also provided geometry2.png as background for the game.

The game consists of three primary files: index.html (initiating and controlling the game), app.css (format rendering), and app.js (game logic and flow).

## References

Mike Wales and Ryan Waite from Udacity provided substantial guidance during their live sessions.  Also deeply appreciate Youness Assassi and Ed Labuda for their deep technical knowledge and direction.

## Game Play Instructions

1. open Chrome
2. ensure files copied locally to your fend_mem_sub/index.html directory, with sub-directories for css and javascript.
3. open index.html
4. click on any of the 16 'cards', flipping them over to find a match.
5. two flips equals one move
6. the object is to match pairs of cards, 8 pairs total, and to do it in as few moves as possible, in the shortest elapsed time.
7. continue playing until all pairs are matched.
8. a 'winner' box will pop up when the game is finished 
9. select either play again or finish

## Scoring

1. the object is to match pairs of cards, 8 pairs total, and to do it in as few moves as possible, in the shortest elapsed time.
2. the game starts with 3 'stars', and stars are removed at 10 moves (2 'stars') and 20 moves (1 'star', which is the lowest rating).


## Notes
This was a long time coming.  Long time.  I've forgotten more than I remember about this effort.
